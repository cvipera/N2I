The World Beyond the Waves

In a world where the oceans were once teeming with vibrant life and infinite mystery,
humanity’s negligence has cast a dark shadow beneath the waves.
The Great Garbage Gyres have multiplied, spreading toxins and suffocating the very heart of the planet.
Once-pristine coral reefs have turned into desolate graveyards,
and majestic sea creatures now struggle to survive in their polluted homes.

But hope is not lost.

A visionary scientist, Dr. Marina Tidewell, has devised a groundbreaking system known as Project Cleansweep,
a network of autonomous trash-cleaning bots designed to restore the oceans to their former glory.
However, the scope of the problem is monumental, and the project’s success depends on you—the player.
Armed with ingenuity, determination, and the support of a global community, you must oversee the operations of Project Cleansweep
and bring the oceans back to life, one piece of trash at a time.

The Player's Role

You play as the commander of Project Cleansweep, starting with a single, humble cleanup bot.
Your mission is simple: collect trash, recycle resources, and reinvest in tools and technologies to expand your operations.
With every click, you’re not just cleaning up garbage—you’re giving the planet a second chance.

But it’s not all smooth sailing. The deeper you dive into the cleanup efforts,
the more you discover that pollution isn’t the only problem. Mysterious anomalies have begun appearing in the deepest trenches of the ocean,
hinting at a connection between the garbage crisis and a far greater threat.

Factions and Allies

As you progress, you’ll encounter key factions that will either aid or hinder your efforts:

Eco Pioneers: A coalition of environmentalists and scientists who provide you with advanced upgrades
for your cleaning bots in exchange for meeting strict recycling quotas.

Corporate Syndicates: Mega-corporations who once profited from ocean exploitation.
Now desperate to clear their name, they offer powerful funding—but only if you agree to some ethically dubious conditions.

The Abyssal Guardians: A mysterious underwater civilization that has been disturbed by humanity’s pollution.
Their cryptic warnings suggest the pollution crisis is awakening an ancient force beneath the ocean floor.

Upgrades and Milestones

Trash-Tier Cleaning Bots: Start small with bots that can collect surface debris.
Progress to advanced bots capable of diving to the depths and neutralizing microplastics.

Recycling Innovations: Develop cutting-edge recycling plants that convert waste into usable resources
like clean energy, building materials, and bio-plastics.

Biodiversity Restoration: Unlock technologies that bring coral reefs back to life and
repopulate fish species. Watch the ocean transform before your eyes as your efforts succeed.

Global Support: Garner attention from the global community.
From crowdfunding campaigns to celebrity endorsements,
every milestone inspires more people to join the cause.

The Hidden Threat

As you clean the ocean, you uncover strange, glowing fragments of unknown origin.
These fragments seem to pulse with energy, and the Abyssal Guardians warn that they are remnants of the Primordial Sludge,
an ancient, sentient pollution entity. Long dormant, it has begun to reawaken, feeding on the waste humanity has poured into the oceans.

Your ultimate challenge will be to face the Primordial Sludge itself. Using the resources you’ve gathered,
allies you’ve made, and the power of Project Cleansweep, you must neutralize this ancient threat and ensure the oceans—and humanity’s future—remain safe.

Victory Condition

Clean the oceans, defeat the Primordial Sludge, and witness the rebirth of a thriving marine ecosystem.
As the credits roll, you see the oceans restored to their natural beauty,
reminding the world of what can be achieved when humanity unites for a common cause.
